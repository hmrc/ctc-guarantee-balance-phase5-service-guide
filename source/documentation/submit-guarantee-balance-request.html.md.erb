# Submit a guarantee balance request

Use the POST endpoint [Get a balance](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/2.0/oas/page#operation/getGuaranteeBalance) of CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0 to get the balance associated with a guarantee reference number (GRN). 

To execute a balance query, you must provide:

- the GRN of the traderâ€™s guarantee
- an access code for the guarantee, which is a 4-digit alphanumeric PIN that is not case sensitive

**Note:** If you want to test the endpoint, see [CTC Guarantee Balance API phase 5 testing guide](/guides/ctc-guarantee-balance-phase5-testing-guide/).

Guarantee balance information is available only for:

- type 0: guarantee waiver
- type 1: comprehensive guarantee
- type 9: individual guarantee with multiple usage

Guarantee balance information is not supported for:

- type 2: individual guarantee (by guarantor)
- type 4: individual guarantee in the form of vouchers
